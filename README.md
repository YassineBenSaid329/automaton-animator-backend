This repository contains the backend service for the Automaton Animator project. It is a robust, production-quality engine for converting regular expressions into their equivalent Nondeterministic Finite Automata (NFA).

The engine is built on a foundation of clean architecture, strict validation, and comprehensive automated testing to ensure correctness and stability.

---

## üèõÔ∏è Core Architecture

The backend is a decoupled, stateless REST API built with Flask. Its sole responsibility is to execute automata-related logic and serve the results in a JSON format. This design adheres to the **Separation of Concerns** principle:

*   `app.py` **(Web Layer)**: Manages HTTP protocols and JSON serialization.
*   `automata_logic.py` **(Logic Layer)**: Implements the core conversion algorithms.

---

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Regex to NFA Conversion**: Implements Thompson's Construction algorithm to handle concatenation (`ab`), union (`a|b`), Kleene star (`a*`), and grouping (`()`).
*   **Strict Input Validation**: A two-stage processing pipeline (Tokenizer and Parser) ensures that only syntactically valid regular expressions are processed.
*   **Certified Reliability**: The engine's correctness is guaranteed by a multi-layered automated testing suite using **pytest** and **Hypothesis**.

## üöÄ Running the Application

There are two ways to run the server. The Docker method is recommended as it is platform-independent and avoids manual setup.

### Option 1: Using Docker (Recommended for All Platforms)

This is the easiest and most reliable way to run the application. The commands are identical for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

**Prerequisites:**
*   [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) must be installed and running on your system.

**Instructions:**

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd backend
    ```

2.  **Build the Docker image:**
    This command packages the application into a self-contained image named `automaton-animator-backend`.
    ```bash
    docker build -t automaton-animator-backend .
    ```

3.  **Run the Docker container:**
    This starts the application server in the background on port 5000.
    ```bash
    docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name automaton-backend automaton-animator-backend
    ```

4.  **Verify it's working:**
    Make a test request using `curl` or any API client.
    ```bash
    curl -X POST \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{"regex": "a(b|c)*"}' \
      http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/regex-to-nfa
    ```

### Option 2: Local Development Setup (For Contributors)

This method is ideal if you plan to modify the source code or run the test suite directly.

**Prerequisites:**
*   Python 3.12+

**Instructions:**

1.  **Clone the repository and navigate into it.**

2.  **Create a virtual environment:**
    *Note: You may need to use `python` instead of `python3` depending on your system's configuration.*
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```

3.  **Activate the virtual environment:**

    *   **On Windows (PowerShell):**
        ```powershell
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

    *   **On macOS and Linux:**
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

4.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5.  **Run the Flask development server:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
    The API will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## üß™ Running the Test Suite

To run all automated tests (requires the local development setup):

```bash
pytest```
